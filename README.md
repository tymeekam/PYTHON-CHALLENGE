# PYTHON-CHALLENGE
For this challenge I am tasked to complete two separate analysis. The first analysis is within the PyPoll folder.

I am tasked with helping helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process with a given set of poll data. The below list was analyzed and I was able to calculate each of the following values:

The total number of votes cast

A complete list of candidates who received votes

The percentage of votes each candidate won

The total number of votes each candidate won

The winner of the election based on popular vote

The next challenge is labeled PyBank. Here I was tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of a

company given a financial dataset composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses". I was able to analyze the records to 

calculate each of the following values:

The total number of months included in the dataset

The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
